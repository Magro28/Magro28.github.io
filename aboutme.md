subtitle: Super interesting things about me
---


My name is Mario. I like to travel the world, try new technology and to code weird things.

 Iâ€™m working for [Micromata](http://www.micromata.de) in [Kassel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kassel) as a Software Developer on different research, logistics and health care projects for big costumers. I'm specialized in __Web Applications__ from frontend to backend, __Big Data Technologies__ and doing DevOps with __Docker__. For short mostly I turn hot coffee and tea into cool code. In my free time I like play around with some game engines or doing other kind of experiments with my Raspberry Pi.

 I enjoy watching ice hockey, driving motorcycles and most of all traveling around the world. Meet new people and get in funny situations.
